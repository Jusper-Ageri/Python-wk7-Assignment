# Python-wk7-Assignment
# 📊 Data Analysis with Pandas and Visualization with Matplotlib

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this assignment is to:
1. Load and explore a dataset using **Pandas**.
2. Perform basic data analysis and compute summary statistics.
3. Visualize the results using **Matplotlib** (and optionally Seaborn).
4. Draw meaningful insights from the dataset.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- The **Iris dataset** from `sklearn.datasets` is used for this project.
- It contains 150 samples with 4 numerical features:
  - Sepal Length (cm)
  - Sepal Width (cm)
  - Petal Length (cm)
  - Petal Width (cm)  
- Target column: `species` (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

You can replace this with any CSV dataset of your choice.

## 📖 Tasks

### **Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset**
- Loaded the dataset using `pandas`.
- Displayed the first 5 rows of the dataset.
- Checked dataset info (columns, data types, missing values).
- Cleaned the dataset (no missing values in Iris).

### **Task 2: Basic Data Analysis**
- Computed basic statistics with `.describe()`.
- Grouped data by species and calculated mean values.
- Observed interesting patterns (e.g., Setosa has smallest petals, Virginica has largest).

### **Task 3: Data Visualization**
Created four types of visualizations:
1. **Line Chart** – Sepal Length over sample index.
2. **Bar Chart** – Average Petal Length per species.
3. **Histogram** – Distribution of Sepal Width.
4. **Scatter Plot** – Relationship between Sepal Length and Petal Length.

All plots are customized with titles, axis labels, and legends.
